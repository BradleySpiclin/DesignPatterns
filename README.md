# Design Patterns in C#

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various **design patterns** in **C#**. The goal is to deepen understanding by writing practical implementations and to provide a resource for other developers who are new to design patterns (just like me).

Each pattern is implemented in its own directory with an example, demonstrating its purpose and how it can be applied.

## Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help improve **code maintainability**, **scalability**, and **reusability** by promoting best practices and standard solutions.

## Who Is This For?

- **Beginners** looking to understand design patterns in a practical way.
- **Anyone** interested in object-oriented design principles.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BradleySpiclin/DesignPatterns.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a pattern directory and explore the implementation.
3. Run the example using the .NET CLI or Visual Studio:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
4. Read the corresponding **README.md** file for a detailed explanation of each pattern.

## Patterns Implemented

- **Strategy Pattern** – Encapsulates algorithms and allows them to be selected at runtime.
- **Observer Pattern** – Allows objects to subscribe and react to state changes in another object.
- *(More patterns will be added as the repository grows!)*

## Contributing

Contributions and discussions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
